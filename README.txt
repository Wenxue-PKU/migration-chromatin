This directory contains the data and scripts required to generate the plots and analysis in the paper:

Paper name
Elsie Jacobson

The DESeq2 folder contains the featureCounts matrix and all downstream gene expression analysis
The homer folder contains scripts that require DGE data, so it is recommended that the DESeq2 scripts are run first
The topdom folder contains data relating to topologically associated domain analysis

The folders are structured:
/data contains pre-processed data required for the analyses
/scripts contains the scripts
/results contains all non-plot outputs of the scripts
/plots contains the plots generated by the scripts
README.txt contains more specific details for the folders
