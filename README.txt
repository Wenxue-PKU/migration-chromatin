This directory contains the data and scripts required to generate the plots and analysis in the paper:

The 00_RNAseq folder contains the featureCounts matrix and all downstream gene expression analysis
The 01_Hi-C folder contains scripts that require DGE data, so it is recommended that the RNAseq scripts are run first

The folders are structured:
/data contains pre-processed data required for the analyses
/scripts contains the scripts
/results contains all non-plot outputs of the scripts
/plots contains the plots generated by the scripts
README.txt contains more specific details for the folders
